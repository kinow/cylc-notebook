    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cylc](https://cylc.github.io/cylc/) is a workflow engine, written in Python, and used by [NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz), [MetOffice](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) and others. It handles continuous workflows of cycling tasks. We will learn more about cylc, how it can be used, its features and more on this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The cylc software can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/cylc/). The [installation instructions](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/blob/master/INSTALL.md) are easy to follow and should work on most Linux distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a computer with Linux and Python 2.x, where you can also install other software and libraries such as Jinja2 and graphviz.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a [section in the FAQ](https://cylc.github.io/cylc/faq.html#how-do-i-install-cylc) that covers how to install cylc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the cylc installation by running the following command."
